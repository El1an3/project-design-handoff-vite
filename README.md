# Design Handoff Project

This weeks assignment was to work with a designer from the UX bootcamp. We were asked to follow their design and should either use styled components or tailwind css instead of vanilla css to style the project.

## Getting Started with the Project

I started by setting up the basic components and reusable components for the project.
Then I set up and styled the first components starting with the easier ones like the quote or the about part. This made it easier for me to get used to the styled components approach.
